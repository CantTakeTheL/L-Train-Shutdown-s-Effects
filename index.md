### Chelsea

- The L train shutdown would make it harder for people on the lower part of the neighborhood to travel to Brooklyn

- MTA plans to create new bus lanes that start at Bushwick in Brooklyn, go over the Williamsburg Bridge, and reach Delancey Street and other Manhattan locations. New restrictions on the bridge would make movement over the bridge more efficient.

- I propose a new bus route that starts at 14th Avenue and Avenue C (where the 14D bus route near lower Chelsea ends) and runs along the L line.


### East New York
##### For more information visit: (https://christineramiro.github.io/East-New-York/) 

- The shutdown would remove residents of an easy way into Manhattan

- MTA proposes free MetroCard transfers between the 3 train at Junius Street, near the edge of East New York, and Livonia Avenue, where the L train starts during the shutdown.

- Service should be increased on the 3 line, and the 4 train, which normally bypasses Junius Street in normal daytime service, should also run there longer hours; the line’s Manhattan route reaches Union Square, a complex that the L normally stops at


### Canarsie

- Besides the L, there are no subway stations in the neighborhood. The L’s cut-off at Canarsie-Rockaway would force commuters to take buses to access nearby trains.

- Increased service on the B6 bus would open up another transit option. The B6 moves through Canarsie along Glenwood Road and reaches the Brooklyn College- Flatbush Avenue station with the 2 and 5 trains.
